# Manufacturers
# Mandatory keys

#
# NOTES:
# 1. Manufacturer name is compared to existing manufacturers in Netbox.

#    these names simple, e.g. cisco, arista, juniper, etc.

# Devices
# Mandatory keys
#   device: Name of the device
#   site: The site in which the device is located (could be a fabric name, testbed, or physical location, etc)
#   mgmt_ip: The IP address of interface used to manage the device
#   interface: The interface used to manage the device, e.g. mgmt0 for NX-OS
#   role: The device's functional role e.g. spine.
#   type: The hardware device type which defines the device's make & model.
#
# Optional keys
#   interface_type: The type of interface (pertains to mgmt0). If not present, mgmt0 interface_type defaults
#                   to 1000base-t
#   mac_address: The mac address of the interface e.g. from 'show interface mgmt0'
#   rack: The rack in which device resides (rack must be present in racks section of this file)
#   position: The bottom-most position (RU) in the rack that the device occupies (e.g. for a 3-RU
#             unit taking spaces 1-3, you would list 1 as the position).  If rack is specified,
#             position must also be specified.
#   face: The rack face the device is installed in. Valid values: front, rear
#   serial: The serial number of the device e.g. from 'show module'
#   tags: A YAML list of tags to associate with the device to enable filtering based on tag.
# NOTES
# 1. role. This must match an entry in device_roles section.
#          Use 'unknown' if you don't know the role
#          Use 'na' if the role is not applicable
# 2. type. This must match an entry in device_types section.
# 3. tags. All tags must be listed in the tags section of this file.  We could have written the
#          scripts to create tags "on demand" if they are added to a device below but are not 
#          present in netbox, but that would likely result in "tag explosion."  Instead, we 
#          opted to force the user to think about why they are adding a tag by requiring that
#          all tags be listed in the tags section. This also forces you to document all your
#          tags in a single place.
