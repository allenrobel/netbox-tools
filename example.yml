# Devices
# Mandatory keys
#   device: Name of the device
#   site: The site in which the device is located (could be a fabric name, testbed, or physical location, etc)
#   interface: A pointer to the interface used to manage the device. 
#              The pointer is a key name in the interfaces dictionary in this file.
#        For example, if the following is used as the management interface:
#           interface: cvd_leaf_1_mgmt0
#        We must have something like the following in the interfaces section
#        interfaces:
#           cvd_leaf_1_mgmt0:
#             interface: mgmt0
#             mgmt_only: True
#             mac_address: 0000.014f.ffde
#             etc...
#   role: The device's functional role e.g. spine.
#   type: The hardware device type which defines the device's make & model.
#
# Optional keys
#   cluster: the virtualization cluster that VMs in this device belong to (see clusters section)
#   interface_type: The type of interface (pertains to mgmt0). If not present, mgmt0 interface_type defaults
#                   to 1000base-t
#   mac_address: The mac address of the interface e.g. from 'show interface mgmt0'
#   rack: The rack in which device resides (rack must be present in racks section of this file)
#   position: The bottom-most position (RU) in the rack that the device occupies (e.g. for a 3-RU
#             unit taking spaces 1-3, you would list 1 as the position).  If rack is specified,
#             position must also be specified.
#   face: The rack face the device is installed in. Valid values: front, rear
#   serial: The serial number of the device e.g. from 'show module'
#   tags: A YAML list of tags to associate with the device to enable filtering based on tag.
# NOTES
# 1. role. This must match an entry in device_roles section.
#          Use 'unknown' if you don't know the role
#          Use 'na' if the role is not applicable
# 2. type. This must match an entry in device_types section.
# 3. tags. All tags must be listed in the tags section of this file.  We could have written the
#          scripts to create tags "on demand" if they are added to a device below but are not 
#          present in netbox, but that would likely result in "tag explosion."  Instead, we 
#          opted to force the user to think about why they aspeedre adding a tag by requiring that
#          all tags be listed in the tags section. This also forces you to document all your
#          tags in a single place.
